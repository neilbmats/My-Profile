				<h2><b><ins>Personal Information<ins><b></h2>

			<p>Welcome to my webpage. My name is Neil Biju Mathew, and my student ID is s3961553.
         I can be contacted through my student email which is s3961553@student.rmit.edu.au.
         I was born in India and I hold an Indian passport but I have been studying in Australia since 2018.
         Along with English, I also speak Malayalam which is my mother tongue and mainly use it with my parents and family.
        I completed most of my secondary education in Australia and now I am doing Bachelor of IT at RMIT. I have been working at
         Hungry Jacks for about 3 years and on my way to getting certified as a manager.

Even though I got absolutely no skill in singing, listening to music is something I enjoy a lot, maybe a bit too much.
The main genre of music I listen to are hip-hop and rnb but my taste in music spreads across various languages and artists.
Soccer and track events are my fav sport activities to get involved in and I am planning to get back into it by next season.
</p>

<h2><b><ins>Interest in IT<ins><b></h2>

       <p>Ever since I was a child I have been really interested in anything that involves battery or any other electronic/electrical devices.
          Taking devices apart and messing around with it was something I enjoyed even though I never knew how to put it back together.
           My father being an IT professional is one of the main reasons towards my interest in technology but it was not until the recent years that I understood the specifics of IT and how it is used around the world.
            RMIT came into my attention as I was looking for possible courses to do after year 12. My interest in RMIT grew after I worked for an event management service which set up the 2021 RMIT graduation.
             The massive event where people were rewarded their graduation certificate really made me want to graduate from RMIT one day. During my study at RMIT I am expecting to gain knowledge regarding my area of study and graduate with a bachlors degree by the end of the course.
             I later plan to use that degree to get a job in a workforce.

<h2><b><ins>Ideal Job<ins><b></h2>
<h4><a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/139693103427527366-security-engineering-manager-identity-and-authentication/?company=Google&company=YouTube&distance=50&location=Australia&location=Melbourne,%20Australia&q=security"><i>Security Engineering Manager, Identity and Authentication</i> </a></h4>

  <br>

  <h3><i>Job Discription</i></h3>
  <p>This position at google works closely with security involving all its users around the world.
    This position requires you to be passionate about safety and should be able to fix, maintain and improve security systems at google which provides a safer operational environment for its users.
     Protecting highly sensitive information like passwords and customer data while maintaining network equipment and monitoring for threats and attacks is one of the main role of a security engineering manager.
      Being an expert in security domains and leading a skilled team which works towards googles security goals is also a key part of this role and the main thing that interests me about this position.
       Being able to work in Melbourne, Australia is also a key attraction of this job as I get to stay with my family while focusing on my job.</p>
<br>
<h3><i>Qualification requirements</i></h3>
<p>The minimum qualifications required for this position are Bachelor’s of degree in computer science or other equivalent practices, 5 years of experience managing a team of engineering or security professionals and 5 years of technical experience as an individual security professional. Even though these are the minimum qualification requirements for this position, additional skills such as experience in protecting systems, security research and testing of security platforms is highly recommended for success in this position. Strong communication and leadership skills along with proper time management are another important skills that are essential for this role.</p>
<br>

<h3><i>Current skills, qualifications and future plan</i></h3>
<p>I am a long way off from the required qualifications for this position. I am aware that there is a lot of experience required for this job and I believe that with consistent effort and dedication I can achieve it. Great communication and leadership skills are some of the non-technical skills that I can build up along my years of study and work on top of my current communication and leadership skills to reach the required level for this position.

<h2><b><ins>Personal profile<ins><b></h2>
  <h3><i>Myers-Briggs test</i></h3>
  <br>
  <img class="testresult" src="C:\Users\neilb\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\My-Profile\Screenshot 2022-08-11 132902.png"></img>


<h3><i>What does these results mean to me</i></h3>
<p>The results of the above gives me an idea of what my personality, learning style and creativity level are. Even though I don’t believe it is 100% accurate, I think it provides a good outline which can be used to identify my strengths and weaknesses. The <ins>Myers-Briggs</ins> test shows that I am an extraverted person who is intuitive and works mainly of feeling rather than thinking. I don’t believe this completely describes my personality, but I see some sense it. The <ins>learning style test</ins> shows that I am a visual learner which I agree to. I have always felt that I learn better through visuals and actual demonstrations. The <ins>creativity test</ins> shows my creativity level to be “work in progress”. I believe this is due to me not following up with my ideas and not being sure about the outcome or result.</p>
<br>
<h3><i>How do I think these results will influence my performance in a team</i></h3>
<p>The above results shows that I am extraverted person who goes off by their emotions most of the time. These results do not completely define me, and I am confident in my ability to work in a team. From my current and previous experiences, working in a team is something that I enjoy and consider my strength. My “work in progress” level of creativity is something that I need to work on in order to be able to effectively contribute to a creative team. Even though I am visual learner, I am confident in my ability to understand verbal information. By putting more effort into both visual and auditory learning, I believe I will be able to work effectively in a team.</p>


<br>
<h3><i>How should I take this into account when forming a team</i></h3>
<p>The main things that I should consider when forming a team is my ability to understand and communicate effectively with my team members. Forming a team of people with similar personality trait and learning style is the best and easiest way. However, I believe that having different types of people with different attributes and skills are a key part of forming an efficient team. Working around the challenges that arise should also be a key part when considering team formation.</p>
<br>

<h2><b><ins>Project Idea<ins><b></h2>
  <h3><i>Motion activated security system</i></h3>
  <p> I am planning to create a motion activated system for my bedroom drawer that can notify me every time a motion is censored in the drawer. However, this device can be used in other areas where the user desires to. I am planning to make this project with an idea of receiving push notifications on my device every time motion is censored in my drawer but in case, I am not able to stick to the idea of push notifications, then I am planning to set it up with an alarm device that sets off as
    motion is detected. I find this project interesting because it provides a solution to a real life of privacy, and it involves aspects of security. The cost of making this project is another reason why I decided to do this project as it is quite cheap. My plan is to complete this project under $50 but I am willing to make modifications to it along the way.  I believe this project would be a good start to get an idea of security and the things that revolve around it. This project could also
    set me up with skills such as time management and security monitoring which could help me with the job I am aiming for. The main requirement of this project is being able to switch the security device on and off to prevent the device from setting of when not in use. Even though this device is not really practical in the current state but I believe this will be a good learning experience to get more familiar with ESP32 adrino.  </p>
<br>
<h3><i>Tools, technologies and skills required</i></h3>
<p>The main reason why I choose this project is the feasibility. This project can be created without much difficulty with access to the right tools, technology and skill. The main parts required for this project are ESP 32 Adrino, Mini IR motion senor module, PCB Breadboard and music IC module along with a small speaker in case the push notification idea doesn’t work out. Basic soldering and electronic skills along with some basic coding skills is required to complete the project successfully.
  Coding the Adrino module to respond to the motion sensor is something that I need to learn in order to complete this project. The hardest part of this project is creating a website to receive notifications every time the sensor is set off. Based on my current skills the idea of receiving notifications does not seem so feasible but I believe that I would be able to complete it with the right amount of research and practice. </p>

<br>
<h3><i>Expected outcome</i></h3>
<p>If the project is successful, the expected outcome is a security device which can notify the user when motion is detected. This will be able to solve my day-to-day problem of keeping people away from my personal drawer and can be used in other areas of the house to increase safety and security. I don’t expect this project to be completely practical as it is a test device that can contribute to my learning. For this device to be practical, various areas such as security, feasibility and
  practicality should be investigated at a greater detail. </P>
